# Problem 3: Design and Marketing

## Problem Description

In the final step, we would like to design a demo space for customers to present our neuro intelligence
platform. The aim is to demonstrate the IDUN full-stack product. Consider the following:

- You have unlimited resources and can include any technology that you deem relevant to highlight the product
- You donâ€™t need to restrict yourself

### The tasks

- Sketch the demo space graphically
- What do you think are important factors that would highly attract customers in highlighting the hardware and software?
